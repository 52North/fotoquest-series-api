# 52n Series REST API
The 52n Series REST API (formaly known as timeseries-api) provides a thin 
access layer to sensor data via RESTful Web binding with different output 
formats like json, pdf or png.

Note: We renamed the project to better align with the intend to provide 
sensor data rather than just timeseries data. 

## Developing
We try to follow [the GitFlow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), 
although we do not see it that strict. 

However, make sure to do pull requests for features, hotfixes, etc. by
making use of GitFlow. Altlassian provides [a good overview]
(https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow). of the 
most common workflows.
