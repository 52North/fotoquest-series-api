# timeseries-api

The timeseries API provides a thin access layer to timeseries data via
RESTful Web binding with different output formats like json, pdf or png.

## Developing
We try to follow [the GitFlow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), 
although we do not see it that strict. 

However, make sure to do pull requests for features, hotfixes, etc. by
making use of GitFlow. Altlassian provides [a good overview]
(https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow). of the 
most common workflows.

## Documentation

The API documentation is in the 52Â°North wiki:
